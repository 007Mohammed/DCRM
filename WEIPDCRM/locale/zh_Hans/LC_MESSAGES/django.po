"This is a list of virtual packages that this one provides. Usually this is "
"used in the case of several packages all providing the same service. For "
"example, sendmail and exim can serve as a mail server, so they provide a "
"common package (\"mail-transport-agent\") on which other packages can "
"depend. This will allow sendmail or exim to serve as a valid option to "
"satisfy the dependency.  This prevents the packages that depend on a mail "
"server from having to know the package names for all of them, and using '|' "
